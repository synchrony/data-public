@title the AKASO recorded 25:43+25:43+0:50 = 52:16 of video using its current (non-default) settings and its own just-charged battery (note that these batteries are years older than the Apexcam batteries), taking 8276 MB. It stopped when it ran out of battery, not memory. The AKASO thus consumed about 158 MB per minute.
