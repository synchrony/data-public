@title neo4j.org was around years before neo4j.com. By late 2007, the tagline under Neo4j on neo4j.org was already "the graph database". Probably because this was an unfamiliar term at the time, the text of the website also describes Neo as a "netbase - a network-oriented database" before making the connection to the mathematical notion of a graph. Ergo, Neo4j has always been a "graph database".
