@title one way in which dreams often distinguish themselves from daydreams, apart from vividness and surprising content, is that the events of a dream often stand in opposition to one's will, whereas daydreams are fantasies which usually conform to your will. You "get what you want" in a daydream, whereas a dream can be more of a struggle.
