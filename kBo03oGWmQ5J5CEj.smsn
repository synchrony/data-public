@title the cameras turn out to be pretty comparable in terms of battery life and storage requirements. This is surprising since a) the batteries in the AKASO are 2.5 years older, and b) I never seem to be able to record as much video as I want using the AKASO; it always cuts my flights short. I don't think I have ever gotten 52 minutes worth of continuous video out of it, but apparently it is capable of such.
