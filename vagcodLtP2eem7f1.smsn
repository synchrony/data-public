@title Merely noting that a thing has a rhtyhm can, at least sometimes, seem to explain some of the thing in question -- the rhythm of work-life balance, for instance, or the rhythm of peace. For an activity to have rhythm is for those undertaking it to know, at each moment, what comes next. Rhythm can thus serve as a stand-in for deeper properties like certainty, security, wisdom.
