@title Show me your schemas, and I will show you a graph! Although graph databases have become very popular in the enterprise, deep expertise in graphs is still in short supply (see "Building an Enterprise Knowledge Graph @Uber: Lessons from Reality" from KGC 2019). Developers often think of graphs as a completely different kind of thing from the rest of their company's data, and will go to great lengths to force their data into a "graph" shape. The amount of manual effort involved in building and maintaining ETL pipelines can become a bottleneck and a maintenance burden. In fact, there is usually a rich domain data model of entities, relationships, and properties which is already implicit in the company's existing schemas, be they interface descriptions for microservices, relational schemas, or various other kinds of storage schemas. Taking advantage of these schemas, and mapping conforming data into the graph, ought to require relatively little extra work, but developers need appropriate tools. In this presentation, we will illustrate such mappings with real-world examples from Uber, as well as introducing formal techniques for schema and data migration. We will also look ahead to the emerging GQL standard as the foundation for a new generation of highly interoperable graph database tools.
