my acoustic's (Colombia 2018) neck has a 16" radius
  christian's strat is probably 12"

F5 in Claudia starts JACK

JACK settings for builtin v. focusrite
  focusrite: 2 in 4 out, 64 samples per buffer
    (fewer than 64 seems to make glitches)
  builtin: 2 in 2 out, 1024 samples per buffer
    (I didn't try to push it to fewer samples)

mics
  lipstick mic rejects worse from the axis with the label than the other one
  big diaphragm mic rejects excellent along its long axis and from behind the label, less well on the barred sides, and hears best from in front of the label

buffer size, latency & pops
  I recorded the metronome into the mic, then looked at the track,
  256 sample buffer size
    10 ms observed latency, 11.6 ms theoretical (2 * 256 / 441K)
    chrome and smsn running, no observed pops in a 13 second recording
  128 size
    5 observed, 5.8 theoretical
    again no pops

ardour: export to CD format ..!
  the higher-depth default is unplayable and fucks up ALSA or something
