@title That "distinction" is for knowledge exams. In the real world, you will develop your own scan...which will be a combination of both. I favor the "selected radial" scan, in which your eyes return to the attitude indicator after a glance at the altimeter, the heading indicator, the nav display, the turn coordinator, etc. Using that scan, your eyes never go directly from one instrument to another except by way of the AI. This is based on a six-pack, of course; glass offers other methods. There are a bunch of suggested scans...no one is best.
