@title "in previous work there has been a strong tendency to treat the data in a data bank as consisting of two parts, one part consisting of entity descriptions (for example, descriptions of suppliers) and the other part consisting of relations between the various entities or types of entities (for example, the supply relation). This distinction is difficult to maintain when one may have foreign keys in any relation whatsoever"
