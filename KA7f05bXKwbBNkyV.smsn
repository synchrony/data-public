@title Scott on the Principal Eng and Distinguished Eng roles: "What you need to get more scale (ie. P./ DE) is the ability to get the management hierarchy to work for you. Only simple plans work. So you have to figure out an accurate summary of the problem/solution that can form the basis for planning and execution at the director or VP level."
