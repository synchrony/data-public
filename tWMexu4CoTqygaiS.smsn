@title "Our goal is to dramatically increase the reliability and robustness of NASA's mission related software, and the productivity of its software engineering, through the research, development, application, and transfer of automated software engineering technology that scales to meet NASA's software challenges. We draw upon many techniques from Computer Science (for example, in the areas of program verification, automated reasoning, model checking, static analysis, symbolic evaluation, and machine learning) and apply them to the verification and validation of software, as well as code generation. Technologies we developed include automated software analysis, automated test case generation, reliable code generation, and risk prediction and analysis."
