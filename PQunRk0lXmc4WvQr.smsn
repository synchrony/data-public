@title I did an experiment with the Suptig battery pack on 2023-03-26, connecting it to GoProMax1 at 5pm, turning the GoPro on, and leaving it on. When I finally gave up and packed my gear in at 12am, the GoPro was not only still accessible via Bluetooth, but showed 100% charge. The battery pack was on red (low charge). That's at least seven hours of standby power, more than enough for my purposes.
