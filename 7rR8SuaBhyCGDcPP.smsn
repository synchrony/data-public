I felt convinced in the dream that I had spoiled the culture when I mentioned sex in public. Whatever it is that a brain does while dreaming, it needs to maintain "sanitary" conditions. I suspect it compartmentalizes, each character supported by a (somewhat?) distinct process in the brain, but ideas spread quickly from one part to the other. And sex, maybe kinky forms of it especially, is an especially virulent meme, at least in my own brain.
   The robot-human distinction in the dream seems likely not pertinent to this aspect. While I was dreaming, experiencing scenes of a handful of people, it feels like my brain was in fact supporting many more characters. (The comparison to Hiroshima suggests a number in the six figures.)
