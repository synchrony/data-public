@title I came across it on Netflix, watched it, and found it excellent. A really engaging true story which seems like it was made for Hollywood, perhaps because so much of the Hollywood old West image was made from it. The acting was first rate, although the lack of an attempt at recreating period dialects and accents was a slight disappointment. I learned a little American history while being entertained.
