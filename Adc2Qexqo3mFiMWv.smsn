@title in the beginning of chapter 1, Job was the most prosperous man in the East; he was rich, devout, and presumably happy. Satan (the Adversary) appears in front of the Lord, who asks him "where are you coming from?" to which Satan gives a vague answer. Satan suggests that piety is easy for Job because he is so fortunate, but that he woud curse the Lord's name if he were to lose his good fortune. The Lord accepts Satan's proposal, saying only that Job himself is not to be harmed. Soon enough, all of Job's cattle, flocks, and young workers, as well as his sons and daughters are killed, as related to Job by four exhausted messengers who barely escaped death themselves. Job is devastated, yet praises the Lord even now, saying the famous words "From my mother's womb, I emerged naked, and I will return there naked. The Lord gave and the Lord took; may the name of the Lord be blessed".
