@title abstract: "It is well-known that Description Logics (DLs) that admit efficient decision procedures are unable to represent structured objects, i.e., objects whose parts are inter-connected in arbitrary instead of tree-like ways. A common solution to this problem is to extend a DL with a rule-based formalism. This either results in undecidability or requires restrictions on the shape of the rules, which typically prevent the rules from representing the required structures. In this paper, we consider an approach for modeling graph-structured objects using answer set programming. While in its full generality, reasoning with this representation is also undecidable, we consider a restriction which allows the representation of graph structured objects and yet the reasoning is decidable. We illustrate how this representation has been useful in exporting a biology knowledge base developed as part of Project Halo."
