I asked someone to describe the two drugs she (and I think the others with us) was using in order to achieve something. She seemed reluctants. I offered to start, and said the one I took was to avoid remembering something. I tried to remember what, and then got mad and said something like, "avoid remembering that this is a bunch of bullshit!" I got very upset, started smashing chairs, while bemoaning, "You're all such wonderful people!" Meanwhile whoever I had asked starts moaning, "No, no!"

I woke up feeling like I could almost see how my brain constructs dreams, using chemicals to isolate regions responsible for different characters in the story, and to make the part that still feels like it's me to avoid knowing I'm dreaming.
