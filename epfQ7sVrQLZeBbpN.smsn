@title introduce weird notes in the chord before using them in the melody
@created 1629608550193
@text More specifically, introduce (time, weird note) pairs in the chord before the melody. E.g. if I want eventually to use a b6 in the 2nd pitch set of the cycle, first play the cycle using the b6 in the chord at that 2nd pitch set, then for a later cycle use it in the melody.
