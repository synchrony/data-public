* :bTcEqaFSnzKKFQz9: "A recent study used scalp-recorded electrical brain activity to explore the physiological time course of synesthesia. This study measured the brain's response to visually presented letters by recording ERPs in 17 people with (visual letter)→(color) synesthesia compared with 17 non-synesthetes. The two groups differed in their average evoked brain electrical activity 200 ms after a written letter had been presented, with synesthetes showing enhanced positivity at frontal scalp locations lasting several hundred ms. The timing of this electrophysiological effect is consistent with the previously described PET findings of cortical involvement in synesthesia."
