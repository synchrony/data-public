@title To move a small number of pitches, use "t<old pitc> h<new pitch>".
@created 1632189277948
@text Example: To move the root up a half step, say "toe hoesh". The initial "t" (think "move To") indicates a move rather than a whole new pitch set is being described. The "h" separates the two vowels, because they are often identical.
