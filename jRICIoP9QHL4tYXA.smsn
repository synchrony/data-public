@title For 46-edo, I don't need all 6 consonants. I'll used "tip kid" instead, and save "fishes" for something else.

Mnemonic: behavior at a restaurant ("tip the kid").

Since will probably usually be saying the pitches of the scale in ascending order, and "t" covers 10-19 while "d" covers 40-45, I shouldn't have much trouble distinguishing them. And since 40-45 is a smaller range (6 instead of 10 digits), that's definitely the one that should be denoted by "d", which takes slightly more time to say than the other three consontants.
