@title It gave me goosebumps.

I got up to pee, and as I thought about the dream, experienced occasional intense goosebumps. That continued as I got back into bed and went over it, planning to write it down in the morning (which I did). Writing it down, I experienced the goosebumps again.

It's cold in this apartment, which makes goosebumps more likely, but they only happened while I was thinking about the dream. Very clear correlation, as I spent most of that time thinking or doing other stuff.
