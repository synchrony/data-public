If I have to delete the notes of the old scale, use a throaty Arab "kh" (because it is the sound of "clearing") as a prefix, to mean "stay at the same root but now play these notes relative to it".

The rolling Spanish "rr" is similar, but it just means a change of focus; the old notes will not clash with the new ones.
